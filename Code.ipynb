an\\nnounced record sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and full year 1997.\\nsales for the quarter were $338 million, reflecting a 30.6% increase over the\\nprior year period on a comparable basis (excluding discontinued businesses and\\ndivested product lines).', 'before the 1996 special charges taken by the company to\\nrestructure and reposition sunbeam, earnings per share (diluted) from continuing\\noperations of $0.47 were $0.50 ahead of the loss of $0.03 reported in the fourth\\nquar ter last year.', 'including these charges earnings per share (diluted) rose\\n$2.76 above the reported $2.29 loss reported in 1996. on a year to date basis,\\nrevenue of $1.168 billion was 22.4% above 1996 on a comparable basis and\\nearnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations of $1.41 was $1.51 above\\nthe loss of $0.10 reported in 1996, excluding special charges.', 'for the full year\\nof 1997, earnings per share (diluted) rose $3.78 from the loss of $2.37 reported\\nin 1996.', '1997 highlights -- during 1997, the company completed its restructuring program\\nand initiated a growth strategy that has generated consistent quarterly double\\ndigit sales growth throughout the year.', 'the company exited all its non-core\\nbusinesses in 1997, closed 18 factories, 43 warehouses and 5 headquarters,\\nreduced employment by approximately 50% (half of which reflects reductions\\nrelated to the disposition of non-core businesses) and substantially reduced its\\nsku offerings as part of its restructuring program.', 'concurrent with the\\nrestructuring program, the company also implemented a three year growth plan to\\nstrengthen the sunbeam(r) and oster(r) brand names and expand distribution\\nglobally.', 'albert j. dunlap, sunbeam\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, said\\n\"i am very proud of the dramatic turnaround that we have achieved at sunbeam in\\nsuch a short period of time as we continue to execute against our three year\\ngrowth plans.', 'our continu ous sales increases of 13%, 17%, 28% and 31% in the\\nfour quarters of 1997, for an overall sales increase of 22% for the year, are a\\nclear indication that our strategy is working.\"', \"the company's three year strategy to achieve $1 billion in revenue growth, which\\nit embarked upon in 1997, was fueled by the addition of 25 international\\ndistribution/license agreements, the introduction of 35 new u.s. products and 54\\nnew international products along with the contribu tion from 22 factory outlet\\nstores.\", '\"we experienced sales growth in all major channels of distri bution, in\\nall regions of the world and in each of our five global businesses, and we\\ngained market share in all of our key product categories, reversing a three year\\ndownward trend, \" said mr. dunlap.', \"sales to the company's top 10 retailers were\\nup 15% and 22% in the latest quarter and\\n\\n\\n\\n<page>\\n\\nfull year, respectively.\", \"international sales which are projected to contribute\\n40% of the company's three year growth goal, were up 42%, and 34% for the\\nquarter and full year, respectively.\", 'leading the sales growth internationally\\nwas the

time\\nfrom over 2 years to approximately 6 months,\" said mr. dunlap.', '\"equally as important as our strong top line growth was the remarkable\\nimprovement in operating margins, year over year,

\"we have\\nestablished sales growth goals that should exceed the impres sive results\\nreported in 1997. in 1998 we will continue our global expansion with the\\naddition of 30 new global products, a dozen more international\\ndistribution/license agreements and 10 more outlet stores.', 'we expect to double\\nour media advertising spending to stimulate increased consumer pull for our\\nproducts and introduce new in-store merchandising programs to assist our retail\\npartners in the promotion and support of our aggressive growth goals.\"', 'the\\ncompany expects to introduce new products in 1998 that will strengthen its\\nglobal product lines, and market positions, by focusing on technological\\ninnovation that satisfies chronic consumer needs.', 'commenting on the effect of the economic situation in asia on the company\\'s\\ninternational growth plans, mr. dunlap stated, \"sunbeam has an advantage in that\\nwe started from a very low base.', 'unlike other companies which have exported\\nheavily to asia for years, we still have an ex cellent opportunity to build our\\nbusiness rapidly in that region of the world.', 'our plans are to ini tially sell\\nour most highly differentiated products in asia, like our electric blankets,\\nblenders, wa ter and air purifiers, hair clippers and toastlogic(r) products.', 'many of the products we will sell there can be sourced from asian oem\\nmanufacturers, providing flexibility to enhance our growth opportunities in the\\nasia/pacific region.\"', 'mr. dunlap said, \"i am confident that we have the right initiatives in place to\\nachieve our goals and further expand operating margins in 1998.\"', 'the company\\nplans to increase the amount of out-sourcing in 1998 to help support its sales\\ngrowth objectives for the asia/pacific region and to allow for added capacity\\nwithout adding bricks and mortar to its existing 8 factories.', '\"currently our\\nmake/buy composition is around 70/30 and i have set a goal for

with, or acquiring, one or more companies that will\\nprovide added value to all shareholders.', 'we also remain open to a sale of the\\ncompany if that would produce greater value for our
